# Make some circles!

Create a 6x3 (6 columns and 3 rows) grid of circles. Make each circle's background color the color written in the picture below:
<br />
(ex: red should be a completely red circle, no words)

<img src="./public/circles.jpeg"/>

### Acceptance criteria:
* Basic :
  * Make localhost:3000 look like the wireframe above by any means neccesary
* Advanced:
  * Create a reusable component and use it build your UI
* Super Advanced:
  * Create this UI keeping it as DRY (don't repeat yourself) as possible.
<br />
<br />
### Stretch Goal:
  * Add an on click function to the circles that will toggle the circle from being completely filled in, to having a white background with the word in the middle of the circle with the font color and border being the color written inside.
